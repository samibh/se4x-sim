libse4x 0.1
A fight simulator for the boardgame Space Empires: 4X and Space Empires: Close Encounters

This is still a very rough initial version. Hopefully it gives accurate results, but
there may be hidden bugs, edge cases or mistakes lurking.

Example usage (a jupyter notebook sample is included):
